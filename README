usage: awk -f assembler.awk <filename>
or, chmod u+x assembler.awk
    ./assembler.awk <filename>
Make sure you're using gnu awk. On the linux machines, awk == gawk, but on
the solaris machines, you have to invoke gawk, and change the "shebang" line
to /software/gnu/bin/gawk.

Assembly code recognized by the assembler:
- operands should be separated by ' ', not by ',' as in the assignment spec
- label definitions should be on a line by themselves
- use spaces for indenting code -- assembler.awk will croak on tabs
- assembler does not resolve labels. These must be resolved by hand.
    Label definitions are printed as comments in the output at the right spot.
- assembler recognizes 'mv' and 'mvi' like in addArray.data,
    not 'mov' and 'movi' like in assignment spec (but you can just change this)
- offsets and immediate values should be in decimal.
    Immediate values should be unsigned.
- comments following an instruction should be preceded by a space
- comments on lines by themselves are ignored
- everything after a valid instruction followed by a space is ignored
- in output, instruction # is printed as a comment before each line,
    as in addArray.data
