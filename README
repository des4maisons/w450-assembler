- operands should be separated by ' ', not by ','
- label definitions should be on their own line
- there should be no tabs, only spaces for indenting code
- assembler does not resolve labels. These must be resolved by hand.
    label definitions are printed as comments in the output in the right spot.
- it recognizes 'mv' and 'mvi', not 'mov' and 'movi'
- offsets and immediate values should be in decimal.
    immediate values should be unsigned.
- comments following an instruction should be preceded by a space
- comments on lines by themselves are ignored
- everything after a valid instruction followed by a space is ignored
- instruction # is printed as a comment before each line, as in addArray.data
